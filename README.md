# Development

## Prerequisite

1. Docker is required for local testing
2. [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) is prefered to install dev env.


## Setup


Checkout the project with submodules included.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:fengyu05/fluctlight.git
```

Then run the setup env, it will run asdf plugins install to install
'python', 'poetry' and 'precommit' to a desire versions.

```
make install
```

## Run the Server

To get started, you will need to set up a Slack or Discord bot by following the official tutorials, or our [tutorial](./doc/create_a_character_on_discord.md). Then, you can run the server locally using Docker by following these steps:

1. **Rename** `env.template` to `.env`.
2. **Fill in the required** `APIKEY` and other configurations as explained below.
3. **Run** `make slack-server` or `make discord-server` to bootstrap the server.

# Configuration

Below explain the main configuration in .env

These are API keys may be used
```
OPENAI_API_KEY # OpenAI API Key, required as default
FIREWORKS_API_KEY # Optional, alternative to the OPENAI Api key.
SLACK_APP_OAUTH_TOKENS_FOR_WS # Optional, for Slack-bot
SLACK_APP_LEVEL_TOKEN # Optional, for Slack-bot
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN # Optional, for Discord-bot
```

These are the main funtional switch
```
BOT_CLIENT="DISCORD|SLACK" # Config whether to bind the Discord or Slack frontend when app start.

#For all special usecase, if you only need a general purpose chatbot, you won't be using these options
INTENT_CHAR_MATCHING=false  # Whether to enable character agent matching
INTENT_LLM_MATCHING=false  # Whether to enable multiply purpose agent matching
INTENT_EMOJI_MATCHING=false # Whether to enable emjoi to agent mapping
```

These are the model config
```
OPENAI_GPT_MODEL_ID="gpt-4o" # To config what model use for all the glue LLM call. Can use mini to save cost.
OPENAI_CHATBOT_MODEL_ID="gpt-4o" # To config what model use for the character tone.
```

These are for debugging
```
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 # To enable tracing using Langchain
DEBUG_MODE # Debug mode(more verbose logs)
```

More spec please see [env.template](env.template)

# Deployment

Botchan can be run locally on your development machine or laptop. For a 24/7 online deployment option:

- Consider deploying the application in a cloud Kubernetes environment, as it is already containerized.

## Discord Bot Setup

Refer to the [Discord Bot Setup Tutorial](./doc/create_a_character_on_discord.md).

## Slack Bot Setup

Follow the [Slack Bot Setup Tutorial](./doc/setup_slack_app.md).

## Security and Privacy Reminder

- Log chat messages only when the debug flag is enabled.
- The repository is not designed for production use, so exercise caution and use at your own risk.


# FAQ

1. makefiles is missing

```
make
Makefile:5: makefiles/alembic.mk: No such file or directory
```

please ensure you checkout the project with `--recurse-submodules` because make file is make external module.
or at least run `make install` once.
